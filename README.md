## About Me
I'm a web-designer and Discord bot developer, who
primarily uses Lua for a large majority of their development.<br />
I've been an avid Lua user for about 6 years, and every day I
strive to become even better. Pushing my extremely inefficient
methods to a new extreme for no apparent reason.
